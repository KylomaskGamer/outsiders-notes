# outsiders-notes
Are you lazy? Are you required to read "The Outsiders" for a class test that you think you will fail and then realize reading the book will have nothing to do with your present and your future? 
Well look no further! This cooly document will have the important things, such as chapter summaries, characters, common questions, quotes, and a full book summary!

## How to use?
It's easy. [Download the DOCX file](https://github.com/KylomaskGamer/outsiders-notes/raw/main/Outsiders%20notes.docx) and open it in either [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/), Microsoft Word or any other DOCX viewer.

## Is this cheating?
Well, you are getting the notes from someone who is also lazy, but you are 100% allowed to modify the file you downloaded. Anyways it is open source. If your school blocked Github, you might as well download it at home. 
TLDR; Depends on your teachers. And you can modify it to say YOU did it. cheat prevention :D

## Is this licensed?
I don't care, let the project spread the world! I am totally NOT coming back to this after my test! 
Want to redistribute because it was helpful? Sure!
Want to vandalize your download? Ok!
Want to use this document to summon the demons from the depths of hell? Hey, as long as you don't blame it on me, feel free to explore the darker realms of academia!

## I prefer creating my own notes.
It's fine lol
